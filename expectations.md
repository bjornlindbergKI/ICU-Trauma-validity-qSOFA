# My expectations of you as the student
- Complete a detailed project timeline with relevant dates based on the [generic timeline](project-timeline.md).
- Arrange weekly or bi-weekly phone meetings.
- Keep detailed meeting notes and make these accessible to me (for example
  as a markdown document in the project repository).
- Submit on deadline. I don't expect the submission to be perfect or
  final but I expect it to be on time. 
- If you for some reason cannot keep the deadline then make sure to
  inform me.
- Respond to emails and messages on slack as soon as possible, but no
  later than 48 hours.
- I manage every project as if it would result in a publication in a
  international peer-reviewed journal. I expect you to be interested
  in this endpoint as well.
  
# What you can expect from me
- To keep deadlines.
- To reply to emails/messages on Slack within 48 hours (sooner if you
  specifically ask me to).
- Comment on written work within 5 days from submission.
- To be closely involved with the project and invest time and effort
  in your supervision.
